> Think a translator.

 {% include toc %}


# Introduction

- **On English**: For me, *enticing* but momentarily abstained from (*'Just a TOOL!'*), albeit frequently permeating through my defense, in which case I will embrace it warmly. 
  
- **On Translation**: Translation of literary works first pops into my mind. As an evangelist of *fidelity*, I won't undertake translation in itself. Any translation, delicate it may be, invevitably incurs discrepancies of syntax and lexicon, a fortori cultural or microcultural narratives. ~~(Stop! How come philosophy keeps 'haunting' me?  For instance, MacIntyre's *After Viryue*, Wittgenstein's later thoughts and Saussure's *Course in General Linguistics* are dancing in my head.)~~ If dissemination is required, I opt for adding remarks and explanations for my targeted audience, leaving the original intact. ~~Yet Reception Aesthetics (Stop!)~~
  Then comes the situation where contribution to the original is not a mere philosophy but a tangible fact——where the *author* is still breathing or the *project* remains underway. In fact it's the common case. Olympics and conference interpretting for instance. Of course literally it's an editor's work, voluntary for translators, but are translators subordinate to writers? No. And (maybe unfortunately) I reckon it already assimilated into the professional criteria.
  There's a bonus in practicing translation as a means. Specifically, the context is readily available for your retrieval of vocab and fabrication of sentences. As a result, I envision more extravagance than austerity in my work.
- + That said, step back and have a full view of life. Hopefully through this little excursion I can think a translator, dream a translator.
  
- **On this Post**: Open to update. The textbook is 《英汉互译实践与技巧（第五版）》 by 许建平, from which I excerpt C-E translation exercises to answer and present in this post. Rendering is up to the spur of the moment. It won't be long before the comparative advantage of jotting it down (and not leaast uploading) weathers.

## Update
- **On the textbook**: The aforementioned 《英汉互译实践与技巧（第五版）》 isn't to my taste. My blunder to not have checked before diving into it. ~~Complaint: Among what I've been exposed to, English publications are far more user-friendly than Chinese ones, be them textbooks, journals or literary works. Not only do the English writers show more thoughtfulness, examplified by more detailed introduction/preface/user's guide, chapter summary/concept chart, and glossary, but the publishers also deliver more intuitive typesetting, usually in coloration or at least concise as GTMs. (Plus. English PDFs are of better quality.)~~ After seeking, 《理解与表达：汉英翻译案例讲评》 by 李长栓, 施晓菁 become my pick, whose informative introduction and opinions on translation add to my expectation.

## Unit 1

### 1. Practice of relevant skill

> 谚语是广泛用于民间的短小<mark>精悍</mark>的格言，通常经口头流传下来，大都反映了<mark>劳动人民</mark>的生活实践经验。谚语类似<mark>成语</mark>，但口语性强，通俗易懂，因而很有感染力。
> 
> 谚语往往多少能反映一个民族的地理、历史、社会制度、<mark>社会观点</mark>和态度。比如，有些民族住在沿海一带，靠海为生，他们的谚语往往涉及海上航行、经受风雨、捕鱼捉蟹。像阿拉伯人这样的游牧民族的谚语则多涉及沙漠、草原、羊、马、骆驼和豺狼。尊敬老人的社会就会有颂扬老人足智多谋的谚语。妇女地位不高的社会就有许多轻视、贬低妇女的谚语。
> 
> 人们的经历和对世界的认识在不少方面是相似的。因此，尽管中国人和讲英语的人文化背景不同，但在英语和汉语中有很多相同或相似的谚语。

Proverbs are short, <u>pithy</u> ~~mottos~~ sayings widely used among the folk. Typically passed down by word of mouth, most of them reflect practical life experience of <u>working people</u>. Proverbs are similar to <u>idioms</u>, but more oral and easy to understand, thus quite appealing.

Proverbs can usually to some extent reflect a people's geography, history, social system, social concepts and attitudes. For example, peoples inhabiting costal areas and living off the sea tend to have proverbs involving voyages on the sea, weathering the storms and <u>fishery</u>, while those of nomadic peoples such as Arabs feature desserts, <u>grasslands</u> (note: steppe), sheep, horses, camels and wolves (note: jackal). Proverbs <u>extolling</u> the resourcefulness of the elderly accompany societies where they are esteemed, while those despising or disparaging women tail societies where they are <u>humble</u>.

After all, people have much in common about their experiences and perception of the world. Hence, despite the different cultural backgrounds soaking Chinese- and English-speakers, sameness and similarities abound in Chinese and English proverbs.

### 2. Reflections and Pracitces

> Life would I gladly tender
> For love: yet joyfully
> Would love itself surrender
> For liberty. (Petofi: Liberty and Love)

Petofi, Sandor, <mark>originally</mark> Sandor Petrovics, Hungarian poet. He became successively an actor and a soldier. In 1848 he identified himself with the Hungarian revolutionary cause, writing numerous popular war poems, including " Rise, Magyar" ( 1848 ) , which became the Hungarian national anthem. He died in a battle. His poetry, dealing in a clear, direct style with the themes of love and patriotism and revealing the intense feelings and <mark>convictions</mark> of the author, began a new <mark>epoch </mark>in Hungarian literature. His long <mark>epic</mark> about peasant life in Hungary, Janos the Hero ( 1845; trans. 1866) , is considered his best poem.

## Unit 2

### 1.

> 中 文 热 词
> 中文<mark>热词</mark>通常反映社会变化和文化，有些在外国媒体上愈来愈流行。例如，“土豪”和“大妈”都是老词，但已获取了新的意义。
> “土豪”以前指欺压佃户和仆人的乡村地主，现在用于指花钱如流水或喜欢炫耀财富的人，<mark>也就是说</mark>，土豪有钱，但是没有品位。“大妈”是对中年妇女的称呼，但是现在特指不久前金价大跌时大量购买黄金的中国妇女。
> “土豪”和“大妈”可能会被<mark>收入</mark>新版《牛津英语词典》，至今约有120个中文词条加进了牛津英语词典，成为英语语言的一部分。

~~Trendy Chinese expressions~~ Chinese buzzwords, some of them gaining popularity ~~on~~ in foreign media, usually reflect social changes and culture. For example, the existing ~~words~~ terms *tuhao* and *dama* have new meanings now.

*Tuhao*, once referring to rural landlords who oppressed their tenants and servants, is now the descriptor of people who <u>squander</u> money or enjoy flaunting their wealth. In other words, a *tuhao* is loaded but has no taste. *Dama* ~~meant~~ are the terms for middle-aged woman, but now refers in particular to those Chinese women who bulk-bought/ rushed for gold when its price plummeted/ <u>tumbled</u> not long ago.

<u>Both</u> *tuhao* and *dama* may be included in the new edition of *Oxford English Dictionary*. To date around 120 Chinese sayings have walked into its entries, becoming a part of ~~the~~ English language.

## Unit 3
### 1.

> Euphemism in British speech
> 
> The British are probably the world champions of euphemism. The best of these are widely understood, creating a pleasant sense of complicity between the euphemist and his audience. British newspaper obituaries are a rich seam: nobody likes to speak ill of the dead, yet many enjoy a hint of the truth about the person who has "passed away". A drunkard will be described as "convivial" or "cheery". Unbearably garrulous is "sociable" or the dread "ebullient"; "lively wit" means a penchant for telling cruel and unfunny stories. "Austere" and "reserved" mean joyless and depressed. Someone with a foul temper "did not suffer fools gladly". The priapic will have "enjoyed female company"; nymphomania is "notable vivacity". Uncontrollable appetites of all sons may earn the ultimate accolade: "He lived life to the full."
> 
> Such euphemisms are a pleasant echo of an age when private lives enjoyed a degree of protective discretion that now seems unimaginable in Britain, That left room for “a confirmed bachelor” (a homosexual) or someone “burdened by occasional irregularities in his private life” (leaving the reader guessing whether the problem was indecent exposure,adultery or cross-dressing).
> 
> Writing about dead people is a question only of taste, because they can't sue.Describing the living (especially in libel-happy jurisdictions such as England) requiresprudence. “Thirsty" applied to a British public figure usually means heavy drinking; “tired and emotional” (a term that has moved from the pages of Private Eye, a satirical magazine, into general parlance) means visibly drunk. “Hands-on mentoring" of a junior colleague can be code for an affair, hopefully not coupled with a “volatile” personality, which means terrifying eruptions of temper. References to “rumbustious” business practices or"controversial” "murky" and “questionable” conduct usually mean the journalist believes something illegal is going on, but couldn't stand it up in court if sued.
> 
> In the upper reaches of the British establishment, euphemism is a fine art, one that new arrivals need to master quickly. “Other Whitehall agencies” or “our friends over the river” means the intelligence services (American spooks often say they “work for the government”). A civil servant warning a minister that a decision would be “courageous” is saying that it will be career-cripplingly unpopular. “Adventurous” is even worse: it means mad and unworkable. A “frank discussion” is a row, while a “robust exchange of views” is a full-scale shouting match.
> 
> Euphemism is so ingrained in British speech that foreigners, even those who speak fluent English, may miss the signals contained in such bland remarks as “incidentally’(which means, “I am now telling you the purpose of this discussion”); and “with thegreatest respect" (“ You are mistaken and silly”).

> 泼水节
> 泼水是<mark>傣族</mark>新年的主要喜庆活动。人们互相泼水，表示洗去身上一年的尘垢，迎接新年的到来。泼水有<mark>文泼和武泼之分</mark>。文泼是对长者的泼法，舀起一<mark>勺</mark>水，一边说着祝福的话，一边拉开长者的衣领，将水顺着领口往下浇。被泼的人欣然接受对方的祝福。武泼则没有固定的形式，用<mark>瓢</mark>、用盆、用桶都可以，互相追逐，<mark>劈头盖脸</mark>地泼。被人泼的越多，说明受到的祝福越多，被泼的人也越高兴。

The Water Splashing Festival

Water splashing is the primary celebration activity of the Dai New Year. People splash water on others to wash off last year's dust and dirt, welcoming the arrival of the New Year. Water is either splashed gently or fiercely. Gentle splashing is for elders. people ladle some water and, uttering good wishes while gently pulling loose
his collar, pour it down an eider's neck. The one being splashed accepts it joyfully. On the other hand, fierce splash has no fixed patterns. Runing after each other, people splash water right onto face with a ladle, a basin or even a bucket. The more one is splashed, the more blessings he gets, so the happier he is.

《理解与表达》

## U1 中国制造、中国设计

> 中国公司想创造世界品牌，外国公司想增加在中国的销量，这些都正改变着中国的设计产业。中国制造商意识到，若他们想在本国市场脱颖而出，在外国市场崭露头角，就必须设计更好的产品。索尼这样的外国公司也开始明白，从前海外公司常把随便什么地方设计的产品拿到中国来卖，而现在，中国消费者变得更加挑剔，他们不再那样容易满足了。
> 尽管全球大量的电子产品和鞋等都是中国制造，但这些产品的设计都是在欧美或日本完成的。中国公司制造自己品牌的产品时，通常是模仿国外。但如今不同了，他们都想开创自己的品牌。随着中国公司在设计上的改进，跨国公司意识到，他们的产品需要专门针对中国消费者的品味进行“量身定做”了。这些使中国设计产业开始繁荣起来。中国公司开始建立设计中心或雇人帮他们打造自己的品牌。成百上千的设计顾问公司在上海北京和广州涌现。国外年轻设计师也开始拥入中国，想在这个全球最有活力的消费市场上一试身手。
> 现在，中国约有400所学院提供设计课程，每年有1万名毕业生。些中国设计师获得国际大奖，许多人开始到米兰、东京、纽约等地工作，设计成为中国最热门的专业之一，甚至已渗入到社会生活中。(说明:此为北外高翻某一年的入学考试题)

- Analysis: Newspaper/Magazine. Neutral ~~, monotonous and has a bit of awkward logic. *The Economist* will run a wittier one with a discerning edge and niftier flow.~~
  
- ~~After scrutiny you will find the article though-provoking. For instance, Design is such a broad term and some in the design *industry* seem to label themselves as professionals of this *methodology* rather than their real job.~~
  

As Chinese companies seek to build global brands and foreign ones boost their sales in China, the Chinese design industry is being transformed. Chinese manufacturers realize that they need better designs to stand out at home and make a name abroad. Likewise, foreign companies like Sony are aware it no longer works to fob off Chinese consumers with goods designed wherever—they've grown more demanding and harder to content.

Although a bulk of electronic products and shoes sold around the world are made in China, most credit their designs to Europe, America or Japan. Even when Chinese enterprises made their brand, as often as not they imitated foreigners. But things are different now. As Chinese companies develops local designs, multinationals find it necessary to make products tailored to Chinese consumers' tastes. All this has set the country's design industry booming. With domestic firms establishing proprietary design centers or hiring outsiders for brand-building, thousands of design consulting agencies are sprouting up in Shanghai, Beijing and Hangzhou and young designers are flocking from overseas to try their luck in the most vibrant consumer market in the world.

Currently about 400 Chinese colleges are offering courses in design, with ten thousand students graduating each year. Chinese designers have notched major international prizes and many are working in global design hubs like Milan, Tokyo and New York. Design has become one of the most sought-after disciplines, affecting every aspects of daily life.

## U5 研究收入分配问题要分清两个层次（摘要）

# 新闻英语翻译原则

新闻英语翻译应该遵循德国翻译目的论所提出的<mark>“功能加忠诚”(Function plusLoyalty)</mark>的指导原则。诺德认为，功能是指译文在译语环境中按预定方式运作，忠诚是指译者、原文作者、译文接受者及翻译发起者之间的人际关系。由于忠诚是个人际范畴概念，是指人与人之间的社会关系，而忠信/忠实(fidelity/faithfulness)仅仅指向原文与译文的关系，因此不能把忠诚与忠信和忠实的概念混为一谈。

**第一，新闻翻译的责任重大**如果翻译错误，校对、编辑和发稿人都没有发现而被国内外新闻媒体所采用，其后果将不堪设想，除了会降低本国新闻媒体的信任度，同时也会使国外和本国受众遭受不必要的信息误导。

**第二，新闻受众珍视新闻报道的真实性，而真实性又是新闻传播的根本前提**一般说来，新闻翻译不同于文学翻译，其最终目标是简洁明了地提供事件信息，因而<mark>译者可以无需对原文始终心存敬意和忠实，而是根据受众需要对原文信息进行重塑、编辑、合成和转型，包括变更标题和导语，删除多语信息，增加重要背景知识，重排段落顺序等，以方便读者理解和接受。</mark>因而改变了传统意义上译者和作者以及原作品的关系，建构了一种新型的社会人际关系。但需注意，这是建立在不能歪曲原文信息的前提下进行的。

**第三，新闻翻译是跨文化翻译，不能仅仅局限于字面对等，而应传达出原文内涵，尽量实现功能上的对等**因为各国的国情千差万别，从行政区划到军衔，从选举法到货币，从风俗习惯到社会生活，新闻翻译工作者都要熟悉。如同一个词“foreign minister”,由于各国政体不同，翻译时需要按照译语文化的标准调整文体风格，并选择不同的措辞。如美国的要翻译成“国务卿”,英国的要翻译成“外交大臣”,<mark>德国的要翻译成“外交部长”,日本的要翻译成“外相/外务大臣”。</mark>

**第四，报道者报道事件的角度、立场、出发点、对事件的理解及评论等不可避免地受到其所在文化意识形态根深蒂固的影响，因而新闻传达的内容除了事实之外还有政治文化内涵**。这就要求新闻译者应是具备翻译能力的新闻工作者，熟悉事件所在国的政治、经济、文化，正确识别和体味原稿的政治文化含义，准确把握这些词语在特定语境中的含义与本民族文化含义的共性和差异，把它们准确又恰当地反映出来。

**第五，国际新闻中的信息内容多种多样，它们的社会功能也各不相同**。因此，国际新闻翻译人员在选择翻译信息时必须是多层次的，不仅要满足所在媒体的编辑方针和意识形态立场，而且还要认识到原语和译语在文化期待上的不同，这样才能确保新闻译文的真实性和可信度，并在信息内容和功能上尽量获得不同层次受众的认可。

在该理论指导下，新闻英语翻译过程应该从语用的层面开始。首先确定翻译的目标功能，其次将原文中需要保留重现的内容和那些须根据受众的背景知识、心理期待、交际需要、媒介条件以及指示需求等因素进行调整的内容进行区分。然后根据不同的情况采取不同的翻译方法，注意始终把语篇功能作为翻译过程的焦点。此外，由于新闻文体的主要功能是传递信息，信息的准确性应放在首位。因此，新闻翻译应当给目的语读者提供准确、清晰、易懂的信息，对重要信息力求真实、完整、突出，对次要信息则淡化或省略，并力求完成原文新闻语篇的人际功能意义的传递。现以2010年8月9日Global Times(《环球时报》)上的一则新闻为例。

例1

<mark>Analects </mark>of Confucius Reduce Crime Rate

    According to the New Strait Times of August 8,Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin,Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia hosted the opening ceremony of the nation's Good Values to Prevent Crimes programme,in which Muhyiddin appealed the young people to read Analects of Confucius, China's classical masterpiece.

      The report said that Muhyiddin had always thought highly of Confucian thoughts and moral values.When evaluating Analects of Confucius,he said,"In ancient China,Confucius praised highly moral education and thought it as a core idea.And Confucius's book written down the values pertaining to politics,history,ethics,education and arts,which I believe will serve to reduce crime rate.”

   In recent years,the Malaysian economy has developed rapidly,but also led to many social problems.Muhyiddin said,"The economic development must balance with cultural quality.Thus,the government should vigorously promote the lofty values to reduce the number of young people involved in drugs,illegal racing,baby-abandoning,gambling and excessive drinking,whose bad influences will affect the whole society."

**译文**

马来西亚副首相：读《论语》能降低犯罪率

      据《新海峡时报》8月8日报道，马来西亚副首相丹斯里·慕希丁·雅辛近日为全国“崇高价值观预防犯罪嘉年华”主持开幕仪式。在开幕致辞中，慕希丁呼吁青少年多读中国经典著作《论语》。

     报道称，慕希丁一直以来都非常重视孔子的儒家思想及其道德价值观。在评价《论语》时，慕希丁这样说：“在中国古代，孔子推崇道德教育为思想核心，其作品《论语》详尽记载了政治、历史、道德、教育、艺术等方面的价值观。我深信，这些思想将有助降低犯罪率。”

      近年来，马来西亚经济发展迅猛，但也衍生出很多社会问题。慕希丁说，“经济的发展必须与人文素质平衡。因此，政府应该大力推行崇高价值观，以减少青少年涉嫌毒品、非法飙车、弃婴、赌博、酗酒等罪行，以免这些不良风气影响整个社会。”

由原文分析可以得出，该篇新闻的目的功能主要体现在以下几个方面：信息功能主要是马来西亚首相对《论语》社会价值对其社会问题影响认识的介绍；呼唤功能是呼吁社会关注《论语》,减少社会罪恶；表达功能是多用简单朴实的语言、句式以及引语等传达原文信息。因此，在翻译时应该注意原文目标功能的体现。如标题的翻译，原文的标题为Analects of Confucius reduce crime rate,如果直译为“《论语》降低犯罪率”,则不能把原新闻的主要思想及目标功能传达出来，因此增加逻辑主语，译为“马来西亚副首相：读《论语》能降低犯罪率”使译文不仅忠实于原文内容，而且明确清晰，浅显易懂，能够很好地体现原文标题的社会功能。由此可见，<mark>在标题翻译时可酌情加上逻辑主语，如新闻人物的国籍、消息的事发地点等，并兼顾中英文新闻的异同，适当增补有关介绍性、注释性词语</mark>，可有利于读者理解，并避免产生误会。

此外，新闻翻译时如果仅仅拘泥于原文死译，生搬硬套，而不顾及文体和语言特点，就很难使读者产生共鸣，因此翻译时应该注意根据译入语的特点进行调整。如原文<mark>导语</mark>“According to the New Strait Times of August 8,Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin,Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia hosted the opening ceremony of the nation's Good Values to Prevent Crimes programme,in which Muhyiddin appealed the young people to read Analects of Confucius,China's classical masterpiece.”非常典型，用一句(一段)话就把时间、地点、人物、事件和原因等重要信息作了简要的概括，使读者一目了然。所以，导语是全文的精华和浓缩，译者必须仔细阅读，并能准确翻译出原文的含义。而汉语译文是两句话，把英文中的非限制性定语从句“in which Muhyiddin appealed the young people to read Analects of Confucius,China's classical masterpiece”在译文中根据汉语语言文化习惯增加了“在开幕致辞中”一词，译成独立的一句话“在开幕致辞中，慕希丁呼吁青少年多读中国经典著作《论语》”,使译文流畅易懂，避免歧义。

再如，在原文最后一句"Thus,the government should vigorously promote the lofty values to reduce the number of young people involved in drugs,illegal racing,baby-abandoning,gambling and excessive drinking,whose bad influences will affect the whole society.”中，非限制定语“whose bad influences will affect the whole society”如果字字直译过来，则会引起歧义。因此，译文增加连词“以免”使语句通顺明了。如“(政府应该大力推行崇高价值观，以减少青少年涉及毒品、非法飙车、弃婴、赌博、酗酒等罪行)以免这些不良风气影响整个社会”。

由上面分析可以看出，在翻译新闻文体时，如果我们遵循目的论的“功能加忠诚原则”,不仅能真实传达新闻的本身意思，顾及文体特点，增强其可读性，而且翻译时能做到简洁精练，生动传神，准确并贴切地传达原文的意图、信息与风格。
