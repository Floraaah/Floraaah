> Think a translator.

 {% include toc %}


# Introduction

- **On English**: For me, *enticing* but momentarily abstained from (*'Just a TOOL!'*), albeit frequently permeating through my defense, in which case I will embrace it warmly. 
  
- **On Translation**: Translation of literary works first pops into my mind. As an evangelist of *fidelity*, I won't undertake translation in itself. Any translation, delicate it may be, invevitably incurs discrepancies of syntax and lexicon, a fortori cultural or microcultural narratives. ~~(Stop! How come philosophy keeps 'haunting' me?  For instance, MacIntyre's *After Viryue*, Wittgenstein's later thoughts and Saussure's *Course in General Linguistics* are dancing in my head.)~~ If dissemination is required, I opt for adding remarks and explanations for my targeted audience, leaving the original intact. ~~Yet Reception Aesthetics (Stop!)~~
  Then comes the situation where contribution to the original is not a mere philosophy but a tangible fact——where the *author* is still breathing or the *project* remains underway. In fact it's the common case. Olympics and conference interpretting for instance. Of course literally it's an editor's work, voluntary for translators, but are translators subordinate to writers? No. And (maybe unfortunately) I reckon it already assimilated into the professional criteria.
  There's a bonus in practicing translation as a means. Specifically, the context is readily available for your retrieval of vocab and fabrication of sentences. As a result, I envision more extravagance than austerity in my work.
- + That said, step back and have a full view of life. Hopefully through this little excursion I can think a translator, dream a translator.
  
- **On this Post**: Open to update. The textbook is 《英汉互译实践与技巧（第五版）》 by 许建平, from which I excerpt C-E translation exercises to answer and present in this post. Rendering is up to the spur of the moment. It won't be long before the comparative advantage of jotting it down (and not leaast uploading) weathers.

## Update
- **On the textbook**: The aforementioned 《英汉互译实践与技巧（第五版）》 isn't to my taste. My blunder to not have checked before diving into it. ~~Complaint: Among what I've been exposed to, English publications are far more user-friendly than Chinese ones, be them textbooks, journals or literary works. Not only do the English writers show more thoughtfulness, examplified by more detailed introduction/preface/user's guide, chapter summary/concept chart, and glossary, but the publishers also deliver more intuitive typesetting, usually in coloration or at least concise as GTMs. (Plus. English PDFs are of better quality.)~~ After seeking, 《理解与表达：汉英翻译案例讲评》 by 李长栓, 施晓菁 become my pick, whose informative introduction and opinions on translation add to my expectation.

## Unit 1

### 1. Practice of relevant skill

> 谚语是广泛用于民间的短小<mark>精悍</mark>的格言，通常经口头流传下来，大都反映了<mark>劳动人民</mark>的生活实践经验。谚语类似<mark>成语</mark>，但口语性强，通俗易懂，因而很有感染力。
> 
> 谚语往往多少能反映一个民族的地理、历史、社会制度、<mark>社会观点</mark>和态度。比如，有些民族住在沿海一带，靠海为生，他们的谚语往往涉及海上航行、经受风雨、捕鱼捉蟹。像阿拉伯人这样的游牧民族的谚语则多涉及沙漠、草原、羊、马、骆驼和豺狼。尊敬老人的社会就会有颂扬老人足智多谋的谚语。妇女地位不高的社会就有许多轻视、贬低妇女的谚语。
> 
> 人们的经历和对世界的认识在不少方面是相似的。因此，尽管中国人和讲英语的人文化背景不同，但在英语和汉语中有很多相同或相似的谚语。

Proverbs are short, <u>pithy</u> ~~mottos~~ sayings widely used among the folk. Typically passed down by word of mouth, most of them reflect practical life experience of <u>working people</u>. Proverbs are similar to <u>idioms</u>, but more oral and easy to understand, thus quite appealing.

Proverbs can usually to some extent reflect a people's geography, history, social system, social concepts and attitudes. For example, peoples inhabiting costal areas and living off the sea tend to have proverbs involving voyages on the sea, weathering the storms and <u>fishery</u>, while those of nomadic peoples such as Arabs feature desserts, <u>grasslands</u> (note: steppe), sheep, horses, camels and wolves (note: jackal). Proverbs <u>extolling</u> the resourcefulness of the elderly accompany societies where they are esteemed, while those despising or disparaging women tail societies where they are <u>humble</u>.

After all, people have much in common about their experiences and perception of the world. Hence, despite the different cultural backgrounds soaking Chinese- and English-speakers, sameness and similarities abound in Chinese and English proverbs.

### 2. Reflections and Pracitces

~~Interesting work is also attached~~

> All other things above
> Are liberty and love;
> Life would I gladly tender
> For love: yet joyfully
> Would love itself surrender
> For liberty. (Petofi: Liberty and Love)

Petofi, Sandor, <mark>originally</mark> Sandor Petrovics, Hungarian poet. He became successively an actor and a soldier. In 1848 he identified himself with the Hungarian revolutionary cause, writing numerous popular war poems, including " Rise, Magyar" ( 1848 ) , which became the Hungarian national anthem. He died in a battle. His poetry, dealing in a clear, direct style with the themes of love and patriotism and revealing the intense feelings and <mark>convictions</mark> of the author, began a new <mark>epoch </mark>in Hungarian literature. His long <mark>epic</mark> about peasant life in Hungary, Janos the Hero ( 1845; trans. 1866) , is considered his best poem.

> Evolution and Ethics
> It may be <mark>safely </mark>assumed that, two thousand years ago, before Caesar set foot in southern Britain, the whole countryside visible from the windows of the room in which I write, was in what is called "the state of Nature". Except, <mark>it may be</mark>, by raising a few <mark>sepulchral</mark> mounds, such as those which still here and there, break the <mark>flowing contours of the downs</mark>, man's hands had made no mark upon it; and the thin veil of vegetation which overspread the broad-backed <mark>heights </mark>and the <mark>shelving </mark>sides of the <mark>coombs </mark>was unaffected by<mark> his industry</mark>. (Huxley)

## Unit 2

### 1.

> 中 文 热 词
> 中文<mark>热词</mark>通常反映社会变化和文化，有些在外国媒体上愈来愈流行。例如，“土豪”和“大妈”都是老词，但已获取了新的意义。
> “土豪”以前指欺压佃户和仆人的乡村地主，现在用于指花钱如流水或喜欢炫耀财富的人，<mark>也就是说</mark>，土豪有钱，但是没有品位。“大妈”是对中年妇女的称呼，但是现在特指不久前金价大跌时大量购买黄金的中国妇女。
> “土豪”和“大妈”可能会被<mark>收入</mark>新版《牛津英语词典》，至今约有120个中文词条加进了牛津英语词典，成为英语语言的一部分。

~~Trendy Chinese expressions~~ Chinese buzzwords, some of them gaining popularity ~~on~~ in foreign media, usually reflect social changes and culture. For example, the existing ~~words~~ terms *tuhao* and *dama* have new meanings now.

*Tuhao*, once referring to rural landlords who oppressed their tenants and servants, is now the descriptor of people who <u>squander</u> money or enjoy flaunting their wealth. In other words, a *tuhao* is loaded but has no taste. *Dama* ~~meant~~ are the terms for middle-aged woman, but now refers in particular to those Chinese women who bulk-bought/ rushed for gold when its price plummeted/ <u>tumbled</u> not long ago.

<u>Both</u> *tuhao* and *dama* may be included in the new edition of *Oxford English Dictionary*. To date around 120 Chinese sayings have walked into its entries, becoming a part of ~~the~~ English language.

## Unit 3
### 1.

> Euphemism in British speech
> 
> The British are probably the world champions of euphemism. The best of these are widely understood, creating a pleasant sense of complicity between the euphemist and his audience. British newspaper obituaries are a rich seam: nobody likes to speak ill of the dead, yet many enjoy a hint of the truth about the person who has "passed away". A drunkard will be described as "convivial" or "cheery". Unbearably garrulous is "sociable" or the dread "ebullient"; "lively wit" means a penchant for telling cruel and unfunny stories. "Austere" and "reserved" mean joyless and depressed. Someone with a foul temper "did not suffer fools gladly". The priapic will have "enjoyed female company"; nymphomania is "notable vivacity". Uncontrollable appetites of all sons may earn the ultimate accolade: "He lived life to the full."
> 
> Such euphemisms are a pleasant echo of an age when private lives enjoyed a degree of protective discretion that now seems unimaginable in Britain, That left room for “a confirmed bachelor” (a homosexual) or someone “burdened by occasional irregularities in his private life” (leaving the reader guessing whether the problem was indecent exposure,adultery or cross-dressing).
> 
> Writing about dead people is a question only of taste, because they can't sue.Describing the living (especially in libel-happy jurisdictions such as England) requiresprudence. “Thirsty" applied to a British public figure usually means heavy drinking; “tired and emotional” (a term that has moved from the pages of Private Eye, a satirical magazine, into general parlance) means visibly drunk. “Hands-on mentoring" of a junior colleague can be code for an affair, hopefully not coupled with a “volatile” personality, which means terrifying eruptions of temper. References to “rumbustious” business practices or"controversial” "murky" and “questionable” conduct usually mean the journalist believes something illegal is going on, but couldn't stand it up in court if sued.
> 
> In the upper reaches of the British establishment, euphemism is a fine art, one that new arrivals need to master quickly. “Other Whitehall agencies” or “our friends over the river” means the intelligence services (American spooks often say they “work for the government”). A civil servant warning a minister that a decision would be “courageous” is saying that it will be career-cripplingly unpopular. “Adventurous” is even worse: it means mad and unworkable. A “frank discussion” is a row, while a “robust exchange of views” is a full-scale shouting match.
> 
> Euphemism is so ingrained in British speech that foreigners, even those who speak fluent English, may miss the signals contained in such bland remarks as “incidentally’(which means, “I am now telling you the purpose of this discussion”); and “with thegreatest respect" (“ You are mistaken and silly”).

> 泼水节
> 泼水是<mark>傣族</mark>新年的主要喜庆活动。人们互相泼水，表示洗去身上一年的尘垢，迎接新年的到来。泼水有<mark>文泼和武泼之分</mark>。文泼是对长者的泼法，舀起一<mark>勺</mark>水，一边说着祝福的话，一边拉开长者的衣领，将水顺着领口往下浇。被泼的人欣然接受对方的祝福。武泼则没有固定的形式，用<mark>瓢</mark>、用盆、用桶都可以，互相追逐，<mark>劈头盖脸</mark>地泼。被人泼的越多，说明受到的祝福越多，被泼的人也越高兴。

The Water Splashing Festival

Water splashing is the primary celebration activity of the Dai New Year. People splash water on others to wash off last year's dust and dirt, welcoming the arrival of the New Year. Water is either splashed gently or fiercely. Gentle splashing is for elders. people ladle some water and, uttering good wishes while gently pulling loose
his collar, pour it down an eider's neck. The one being splashed accepts it joyfully. On the other hand, fierce splash has no fixed patterns. Runing after each other, people splash water right onto face with a ladle, a basin or even a bucket. The more one is splashed, the more blessings he gets, so the happier he is.

- *Remark: Language is empowerment and restriction. Kind of primitive to monolingual/media. Kind of futility to add a step M-E （Meaning/Message to English).*

> 梅贻琦
> 梅贻琦(1889-1962)<mark>教育家</mark>、天津人。1909年考取清华第一批“直接留美生”进入吴斯特工业学院学习电机工程。1915年9月应聘来清华大学任物理学教授，1926年出任教务长。1931年出任校长直至1948年年底。他仅用几年时间就使当时的清华大学在许多方面跻身于世界名校之林。作为教育家，梅贻琦有一套完整的教育思想体系，其治校方略可归结为三个组成部分:通才教育(或“自由教育”)、教授治校(或“民主管理”)和学术自由(或“自由探讨之风气”)。其代表作是 1941年撰发的《大学一解》。他的“大学者，非谓有大楼之谓也，有大师之谓也”的著名论说，至今在教育界广为传诵。

~~Outrageous! Such amplification.~~

[U5] Chinese is succinct in structure but elaborate in content/meticulous in description.

> 大作收到，十分高兴。I was very glad to have received your writing.
> 交出翻译之前，必须读几遍，看看有没有要修改的地方。Beforehandingin yourtranslation, you have to read it over and over again and see if there is anything in itto be corrected or improved.

OK...

## Epilogue: From Philosophy to Knowledge and Crafts

### Contrastive Analysis of E-C

---

#### **1. Syntactic Typology**

- **Hypotaxis** (explicit grammatical connections) vs. **Parataxis** (implicit logical flow):
  - EN: "She left the party early *because* she had a headache." (hypotactic with subordinator *because*)
  - CN: "她头疼，提前离开了聚会。" (paratactic, causality implied through juxtaposition)

---

#### **2. Voice and Agency**

- **Passive Voice** (agent defocusing) vs. **Active Voice** (topic prominence)

---

#### **3. Textual Cohesion**

- **Endophora** (text-internal/inner reference) vs. **Exophora** (context-dependent/outer reference):
  - Chinese may prefer lexical repetition over pronominal reference to avoid ambiguity.

---

#### **4. Morphological Typology**

- **Synthetic vs. Analytic Structures**
  - EN: Uses inflectional morphology (e.g., *walk* → *walk***ed**; *cat* → *cat***s**)
  - CN: Relies on particles (了/过) and measure words (个/只) for grammatical functions
  - *Example*:
    - EN: "Three **books**" (plural -s)
    - CN: "三**本**书" (measure word 本 + non-inflected noun)
