# Introduction

- **On English**: For me, *enticing* but momentarily abstained from (*'Just a TOOL!'*), albeit frequently permeating through my defense, in which case I will embrace it warmly. 
  
- **On Translation**: As an evangelist of *fidelity*, I won't undertake translation in itself. If dissemination is required, I opt for adding remarks and explanations for my targeted audience, leaving the original intact. That said, there's a point in practicing translation as a means. Specifically, the context is readily available for your retrieval of vocab and fabrication of sentences. As a result, I envision more flaunting than restraining.
  
- **On this Post**: Open to update. The textbook is 《英汉互译实践与技巧（第五版）》 by 许建平, from which I excerpt C-E translation exercises to answer and present in this post. Rendering is up to the spur of the moment. It won't be long before the comparative advantage of jotting down (and not leaast uploading) weathers.
  

# Unit 1

## 1. Practice of relevant skill

> 谚语是广泛用于民间的短小<mark>精悍</mark>的格言，通常经口头流传下来，大都反映了<mark>劳动人民</mark>的生活实践经验。谚语类似<mark>成语</mark>，但口语性强，通俗易懂，因而很有感染力。
> 
> 谚语往往多少能反映一个民族的地理、历史、社会制度、<mark>社会观点</mark>和态度。比如，有些民族住在沿海一带，靠海为生，他们的谚语往往涉及海上航行、经受风雨、捕鱼捉蟹。像阿拉伯人这样的游牧民族的谚语则多涉及沙漠、草原、羊、马、骆驼和豺狼。尊敬老人的社会就会有颂扬老人足智多谋的谚语。妇女地位不高的社会就有许多轻视、贬低妇女的谚语。
> 
> 人们的经历和对世界的认识在不少方面是相似的。因此，尽管中国人和讲英语的人文化背景不同，但在英语和汉语中有很多相同或相似的谚语。

Proverbs are short, <u>pithy</u> ~~mottos~~ sayings widely used among the folk. Typically passed down by word of mouth, most of them reflect practical life experience of <u>working people</u>. Proverbs are similar to <u>idioms</u>, but more oral and easy to understand, thus quite appealing.

Proverbs can usually to some extent reflect a people's geography, history, social system, social concepts and attitudes. For example, peoples inhabiting costal areas and living off the sea tend to have proverbs involving voyages on the sea, weathering the storms and <u>fishery</u>, while those of nomadic peoples such as Arabs feature desserts, <u>grasslands</u> (note: steppe), sheep, horses, camels and wolves (note: jackal). Proverbs <u>extolling</u> the resourcefulness of the elderly accompany societies where they are esteemed, while those despising or disparaging women tail societies where they are <u>humble</u>.

After all, people have much in common about their experiences and perception of the world. Hence, despite the different cultural backgrounds soaking Chinese- and English-speakers, sameness and similarities abound in Chinese and English proverbs.

## 2. Reflections and Pracitces

> All other things above
> Are liberty and love;
> Life would I gladly tender
> For love: yet joyfully
> Would love itself surrender
> For liberty. (Petofi: Liberty and Love)

Petofi, Sandor, <mark>originally</mark> Sandor Petrovics, Hungarian poet. He became successively an actor and a soldier. In 1848 he identified himself with the Hungarian revolutionary cause, writing numerous popular war poems, including " Rise, Magyar" ( 1848 ) , which became the Hungarian national anthem. He died in a battle. His poetry, dealing in a clear, direct style with the themes of love and patriotism and revealing the intense feelings and <mark>convictions</mark> of the author, began a new <mark>epoch </mark>in Hungarian literature. His long <mark>epic</mark> about peasant life in Hungary, Janos the Hero ( 1845; trans. 1866) , is considered his best poem.

> Evolution and Ethics
> It may be <mark>safely </mark>assumed that, two thousand years ago, before Caesar set foot in southern Britain, the whole countryside visible from the windows of the room in which I write, was in what is called "the state of Nature". Except, <mark>it may be</mark>, by raising a few <mark>sepulchral</mark> mounds, such as those which still here and there, break the <mark>flowing contours of the downs</mark>, man's hands had made no mark upon it; and the thin veil of vegetation which overspread the broad-backed <mark>heights </mark>and the <mark>shelving </mark>sides of the <mark>coombs </mark>was unaffected by<mark> his industry</mark>. (Huxley)

# Unit 2

## 1.

> 中 文 热 词
> 中文<mark>热词</mark>通常反映社会变化和文化，有些在外国媒体上愈来愈流行。例如，“土豪”和“大妈”都是老词，但已获取了新的意义。
> “土豪”以前指欺压佃户和仆人的乡村地主，现在用于指花钱如流水或喜欢炫耀财富的人，<mark>也就是说</mark>，土豪有钱，但是没有品位。“大妈”是对中年妇女的称呼，但是现在特指不久前金价大跌时大量购买黄金的中国妇女。
> “土豪”和“大妈”可能会被<mark>收入</mark>新版《牛津英语词典》，至今约有120个中文词条加进了牛津英语词典，成为英语语言的一部分。

~~Trendy Chinese expressions~~ Chinese buzzwords, some of them gaining popularity ~~on~~ in foreign media, usually reflect social changes and culture. For example, the existing ~~words~~ terms *tuhao* and *dama* have new meanings now.

*Tuhao*, once referring to rural landlords who oppressed their tenants and servants, is now the descriptor of people who <u>squander</u> money or enjoy flaunting their wealth. In other words, a *tuhao* is loaded but has no taste. *Dama* ~~meant~~ are the terms for middle-aged woman, but now refers in particular to those Chinese women who bulk-bought/ rushed for gold when its price plummeted/ <u>tumbled</u> not long ago.

<u>Both</u> *tuhao* and *dama* may be included in the new edition of *Oxford English Dictionary*. To date around 120 Chinese sayings have walked into its entries, becoming a part of ~~the~~ English language.

# Unit 3

## 1.

> 泼水节
> 泼水是<mark>傣族</mark>新年的主要喜庆活动。人们互相泼水，表示洗去身上一年的尘垢，迎接新年的到来。泼水有<mark>文泼和武泼</mark>之分。文泼是对长者的泼法，舀起一水，一边说着祝福的话，一边拉开长者的衣领，将水顺着领口往下浇。被泼的人欣然接受对方的祝福。武泼则没有固定的形式，用<mark>瓢</mark>、用盆、用桶都可以，互相追逐，<mark>劈头盖脸</mark>地泼。被人泼的越多，说明受到的祝福越多，被泼的人也越高兴。
