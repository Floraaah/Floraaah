### Society

#### today's fast-paced nature of science and technological development beneficial or detrimental to the society? 

The rapid pace of scientific and technological advancement will prove detrimental in the long run. First, new technologies often enter public use before undergoing sufficient safety or efficacy testing. The historical tragedy of thalidomide, a drug released before adequate trials, illustrates how premature application can result in catastrophic consequences. Even when not dangerous, unproven technologies often fail to deliver promised benefits, wasting resources and public trust.

Furthermore, the prevailing emphasis on rapid development cultivates a myopic, commercially-driven research paradigm that favors financially safe ventures over genuinely innovative ones. The pharmaceutical sector exemplifies this troubling trend, wherein investment increasingly flows toward conservative compounds boasting high regulatory approval probabilities and immediate profitability, while challenging conditions affecting smaller populations suffer neglect. This risk-averse approach discourages groundbreaking innovation that requires longer development horizons. Consequently, beneath the superficial appearance of technological advancement lies an alarming stagnation of meaningful scientific progress.

#### decreased cash use beneficial or detrimental to the society?
The decline in cash usage brings significant social and economic benefits. First, it enhances regulatory oversight by making financial transactions traceable. Unlike cash, which leaves no audit trail, digital payments can be monitored for irregular patterns, aiding in the detection of money laundering, tax evasion, and other illicit activities. Over time, this transparency strengthens public trust in financial institutions and improves the enforceability of legal norms. 

Second, reduced reliance on cash lowers transaction costs. Physical currency requires printing, handling, and secure transportation, all of which burden both businesses and governments. Digital systems minimize these logistical expenses while enabling faster, more convenient payments. Such improvement in transaction convenience will spur economic activity, as is exemplified by the switch from metal coins to paper money.

#### Should governments provide financial support for artists?
Governments have a responsibility to fund artists because doing so cultivates both cultural and intellectual capital. First, robust artistic communities shape a city's global reputation. Just as Paris is celebrated for its museums and Vienna for its music, public investment in the arts transforms urban centers into cultural destinations, attracting tourism and fostering civic pride.

Second, government-funded exhibitions counteract the superficiality of modern life. In an era dominated by fleeting digital content, curated galleries and performances encourage nuanced engagement. Visitors must slow down, interpret symbolism, and appreciate creative labor—habits that develop sophisticated cognitive skills increasingly rare in today's fast-paced world.

Contrary to Claire's argument, private investors cannot fulfill this role. Profit-driven patrons inherently favor commercially viable art over challenging works of enduring value. History proves this: Van Gogh’s genius went unrecognized by his contemporaries because his innovative style lacked market appeal. Without public funding, society risks losing similarly visionary artists whose contributions only future generations may appreciate.

#### how to promote classical music to young people
The most effective strategy for renewing youth engagement with classical music involves blending traditional compositions with contemporary genres. Contemporary composers like Brian Tyler demonstrate this approach's success by integrating electronic instrumentation into classical frameworks, creating hybrid musical styles that align with young people's listening habits, thus reaching a wider audience. For instance, the Formula One Theme Tyler composed has attracted the young motorsport enthusiasts to classical music.

Besides, the classical genre's characteristic subtlety and structural complexity often challenge listeners accustomed to more immediate musical gratification. However, by combining familiar electronic beats or pop harmonies with classical themes, musicians create accessible entry points that naturally guide listeners toward appreciating more sophisticated compositions. As audiences repeatedly encounter these blended works, they organically develop the attention span and nuanced listening skills necessary to enjoy traditional, pure classical pieces.

#### Under the influence of modern technology, are people healthier?
While modern lifestyles have become increasingly sedentary, technological advancements have paradoxically enhanced global health outcomes. As Claire points out, medical breakthroughs have eradicated diseases like smallpox and transformed previously fatal conditions into manageable ones. However, technology's most significant contribution lies in democratizing healthcare information on medical treatment and disease prevention.

Historically, physician shortages inflated medical costs, forcing many to rely on unproven traditional remedies that often exacerbated health problems. Digital technologies have bridged this knowledge gap by making basic medical information universally accessible. Today, online platforms enable individuals to understand fundamental health principles, reducing reliance on harmful folk treatments while increasing compliance with professional medical advice.

Furthermore, technology has revolutionized preventive healthcare. Wearable devices track vital signs in real-time, while health apps provide personalized lifestyle recommendations. Social media campaigns about sleep hygiene, for instance, have reached over 2 billion users worldwide, significantly raising awareness about the dangers of sleep deprivation.

Therefore, this informational transformation has created a more health-literate global population, both in medical treatment and disease prevention.


#### How to attract urbanites to rural areas?

As urban populations surge, governments must incentivize rural migration by prioritizing transportation infrastructure. Reliable networks—such as highways and public transit—lower business costs and connect residents to essential services, healthcare, and education. For instance, Claire rightly notes that entertainment venues can enhance rural livability; however, without efficient transport systems, such businesses often fail due to low foot traffic and high logistics costs—for example, delayed or expensive ingredient shipments for rural cafes and restaurants. Infrastructure investment not only supports local commerce but also attracts urban dwellers seeking convenience and connectivity.

In contrast to Andrew’s subsidy-focused approach, skill training ensures longer-term outcomes. Financial support alone cannot transform urbanites into successful rural workers. Instead, governments should fund agricultural training programs, combined with transitional stipends, to help residents build the expertise necessary for rural self-sufficiency. By closing skill gaps and providing structured guidance, such programs make the shift both realistic and sustainable, empowering migrants to thrive rather than merely survive.

#### Should the government support the construction of libraries?

I believe the government should support the construction of libraries.

First, libraries eliminate financial barriers to education by offering free resources—from newspapers to research journals—in print and digital formats. For example, a high school student can study cutting-edge scientific discoveries through borrowed academic journals, avoiding expensive subscription fees that would otherwise restrict their learning. This democratization of information fosters lifelong learning and empowers individuals from all socioeconomic backgrounds.

Second, libraries serve as vital social hubs where diverse groups connect. Workshops and reading clubs allow people with shared interests—regardless of profession or neighborhood—to exchange ideas. These interactions build mutual understanding, encouraging civic engagement. A retiree mentoring teens in a library writing group, for instance, not only imparts valuable skills but also becomes a role model, motivating youth to engage more deeply in local volunteer initiatives.

#### Ref: the most significant advantage of museums in a city
> professor: Next week, we’ll be discussing the role of museums in society, and we’ll explore the various contexts, social and otherwise, in which museums operate. Today, I’d like you to think about the benefits of museums. For a city and its residents, what do you think is the most significant advantage of having a museum located in that city? Explain why you think so.
> 
> A: Museums can inspire people in many ways. If a city has a museum, people have access to out-of-the-ordinary experiences. Whether in a room with sixteenth-century paintings or some moon rocks, being near fascinating objects from the past transports people out of their everyday lives. It can offer them a new perspective or a sense of possibility in their lives.
> 
> c: Andrew makes a good point, but personally, I see greater benefit in the social aspect of museum-going. I think the biggest advantage of having a museum nearby is that people can come together for events like exhibitions and lectures or to volunteer. Museums foster a sense of community in a city. They can unite people in a common appreciation of something.

Museums profoundly benefit cities, but their most prominent value lies in fostering **community cohesion**. By offering shared spaces for cultural engagement—such as<mark> historical exhibitions or art workshops</mark>—museums unite diverse residents through <mark>collective </mark>learning. For example, a 2022 study found that cities with museums reported **30% higher social trust** among <mark>attendees</mark>, as interactions in these<mark> neutral settings bridge societal divides.</mark>

Moreover, museums strengthen<mark> civic bonds</mark> by promoting volunteerism. Regular participants—whether staff or visitors—develop<mark> lasting relationships</mark>, enhancing<mark> local pride </mark>and collaboration. In Toronto, the AGO’s volunteer program reduced neighborhood <mark>isolation rates</mark> by **15%** <mark>within two years</mark>, proving museums’ role as <mark>social anchors.</mark>

Ultimately, museums transform cities into **hubs of connection**, where shared experiences combat alienation and inspire collective growth. This social impact outweighs even their educational merits.

#### green spaces or other important purposes, which is the better use for available urban place?

While Claire raises a valid point that cities should prioritize essential infrastructure like healthcare center, greenspaces are irreplaceable and should take precedence over commercial and industrial development.

First, greenspaces address prevalent urban environmental problems. The rooftop gardens and vertical greenery Claire proposes are innovative, but they cannot replicate the scale or ecological functions of ground-level parks. A single large park supports biodiversity, improves air quality, and manage storm water. Besides, according to a Melbourne-base NGO, greenspaces significantly mitigates urban heat islands. Areas with abundant tree cover can be 5-10 degrees cooler than concrete-heavy zones, reducing heat-related diseases.

Besides, greenspaces are the hub of civic communication, enhancing societal cohesion. By providing a shared place for recreation activities and cultural events, greenspaces bridge the gap between diverse social groups. For example, ~~the~~ New York's Central Park regularly hosts free concerts and food festivals, where people enjoy themselves together and create fond memories, boosting mutual trust and local pride. 

Ultimately, cities must balance development and sustainability. Prioritizing greenspaces is an investment in long-term public health and climate resilliance, making it the wiser choice for urban planning.


##### net effect of influencers on followers

The emerging AI avatars in social platforms reignite the debate over online personalities. I believe they generally have a negative effect on their followers. Firstly, influencers often promote biased or misleading content, particularly as more companies sponsor them for advertising purposes. The problem is exacerbated by, as Paul points out, the loss of independent thinking in the follower population. For instance, if a key opinion leader endorses a diet pill, followers may rush to it despite absence of scientific evidence. This distorts market dynamics where promotional budgets rather than product quality determine success, ultimately wasting social resources and endangering public health.

Secondly, influencers frequently present false or exaggerated lifestyles, which can cause their followers to feel inadequate or stressed. Edited photos and fabricated stories are common, and followers who take these posts seriously may develop unrealistic expectations. This can negatively impact mental health, especially among younger users who are more susceptible to self-comparison.


##### Scientific Finding Disclosure
> Should scientific discoveries be shared freely among scientists throughout the world and that governments and companies should not keep any discoveries secret?
+ *So many restrictions, and 10 minutes' time for writing? I believe nearly no one will be willing to spend time contemplating the problem and will go stray more or less...I simply didn't bother.*

I believe the right to decide publish one's scientific discovery or not should be reserved to the discoverer. While as Paul argues, the discoverer deserve public recognition—typically only possible with public dissemination—many scientists prioritize contribution to the human welfare over fame. For instance, researchers publishing breakthroughs in renewable energy enable sequential innovation and broader application, boosting global solution to climate changes. Therefore, voluntary disclosure aligns with personal pursuit and societal development.

However, mandated disclosure can deter innovation by reducing incentives for private investors. Before patent systems, innovators risk losing profits to competitors through commercial espionage or reverse engineering, leading to positive externality problems. If discoveries were forcibly published today, the private sector would cut R&D funding, fearing inadequate returns. This would hinder technological progress, especially in fields like pharmaceuticals where breakthroughs rely on costly, years-long research.

#### who should make more efforts to environmental protection, individuals or factories?
It is difficult to quantify who should make more effort in environmental protection—individuals or factories—since they operate on different levels and contribute in fundamentally different ways. However, if we consider impact scale and systemic influence, factories clearly carry greater responsibility. As Andrew points out, industrial activity generates exponentially more waste than personal consumption— a single factory's annual emissions often surpass a lifetime of individual carbon footprints. Besides, individual efforts rely on the industry. Consider energy production: when power grids rely on fossil fuels, consumers' wide adoption of electric vehicles merely shifts, rather than reduces, emissions.
The true leverage point, therefore, lies in manufacturing innovation.
  
Factories  drives structural transformation through their dual role as both major polluters and hubs of sustainable innovation. Motivated by profit maximization, many firms now maintain dedicated sustainability R&D units, developing cost-effective green technologies that later diffuse across society. For instance, Tesla’s research into battery storage and vehicle-to-grid systems has pushed not only automakers but also energy providers and city planners to rethink infrastructure and invest in cleaner electricity.
  
/Nevertheless, individual efforts remain crucial because they create cultural momentum for sustainability. When people adopt eco-friendly habits—such as using public transportation, reducing plastic consumption, and supporting green businesses—they normalize environmental responsibility. This cultural shift pressures industries and governments to prioritize environmental reforms and implement policies that further accelerate the transition to a green economy。

#### How to promote EVs?
To increase electric vehicle adoption, governments should prioritize the expansion of charging infrastructure. A limited and scattered supply of charging stations hinders mobility and reinforces range anxiety, making electric vehicles less practical.

However, offering one-time subsidies to build stations, as Kelly suggests, is not enough, since ongoing maintenance costs remain uncovered. A more effective strategy is to allow charging point operators to set their own prices. This creates a market incentive: operators will maintain equipment, advertise locations, and seek efficiency gains. Meanwhile, competition will keep prices at an affordable level. The result is a sustainable, self-reinforcing charging network that makes owning and using electric vehicles more attractive.

#### how to reduce carbon emmision?

To achieve meaningful emissions reductions, governments should subsidize electrical vehicles. As Paul astutely observes, public transit systems often prove impractical in remote areas, limiting their application. Electrical vehicles, by contrast, offer unmatched versatility, equally suited for daily urban commutes and long-distance intercity travel, making it a universally appealing transportation solution.

Furthermore, promotion of electrical vehicles boosts technological progress, benefiting the entire society/generating society-wide benefits through knowledge spillover effects. Private automakers' R&D investments in battery technology, for instance, have yielded breakthroughs in energy storage systems subsequently adapted by power grids to optimize electricity distribution and enhance overall energy efficiency. According to McKinsey, 78% of Fortune 500 companies maintain dedicated research facilities. By introducing financial incentives like tax rebates, governments align companies' interest with sustainable development and unleash the innovation potential of private sector.

### Workplace

##### Four-day workweek?

While Claire points out the frictions of switching from a five-day workweek to a four-day one, the difficulty is temporal rather than fundamental—the six-week schedule was not abolished until decades ago, yet nobody today questions the five-day one. Generally, I believe the benefits of a shortened weekday outweigh troubles it may bring.

First, productivity improves. Five consecutive workdays often lead to Friday fatigue, diminishing employees' focus. By contrast, a condensed workweek encourages efficiency, as employees stay fresher and more engaged. For instance, a Microsoft Japan trial saw a 40% productivity boost after adopting the new schedule, proving shorter workweek yields better output.

Second, individual wellbeing and economy activity rise. A three-day weekend enables more leisure travel or personal development, increasing consumer spending, especially in hospitality and retail sectors. For example, workers can take weekend trips to nearby cities, boosting local tourism.

##### Communication methods
> Over the next few weeks, we'll begin discussingcommunication strategies in the workplace. Thesedays there are many options for workplacecommunications. Sometimes people choose tocommunicate in writing through email or throughmessaging apps, while at other times they prefertalking to others face-to-face or by phone. What isthe most important factor to consider when decidingwhether to communicate in writing or by speakingin the workplace? Why?

While Andrew and Claire raise valid points about privacy and familiarity, I believe the most crucial factor in choosing the communication method is the urgency of the message.

For time-sensitive issues, verbal communication, which enables immediate confirmation and feedback, proves far more effective. A customer service agent handling an angry client, for instance, must address complaints immediately through phone calls or face-to-face interaction to prevent escalation. If wirrten messages were used in such scenarios, dangerous delays and confusion would result.

By contrast, he asynchronous nature of written communication makes it ideal for non-urgent matters. For instance, weekly project updates sent via email allow employees to review information at their convenience without disrupting focused work time. Besides, written documentation keeps records, allowing for thorough review. Thus, they will accumulate as a rich seam of experience, useful for both personal improvement and onboarding training.

##### Should companies allow occasional remote work?
While remote work enables better work-life balance as Claire notes, it simultaneously undermines work efficiency. The comfortable home environment reduces vigilance, and family members often interrupt focus. The lack of structural supervision - whether from managers or peer pressure - further compounds these challenges in remote settings. In contrast, physical workplaces maintain a productive atmosphere that naturally discourages slacking while providing immediate support when difficulties arise.

Additionally, remote work erodes employees' organizational identity. The absence of face-to-face interactions eliminates opportunities for casual breakroom conversations, leaving coworkers as mere names on screens rather than developing meaningful connections. Consequently, when talented employees feel no emotional attachment to their workplace, they become more likely to quit when competitors offer marginally better compensation packages.

##### Should companies provide employees with time and money to attend universities?
I believe companies should support employees' academic pursuits through subsidies or study leave.

First, investing in employees' academic development enhances retention and counters brain drain. While opponents like Andrew argue this may cause employees to leave, well-established contractual safeguards like non-compete clauses effecitively mitigates this risk. When companies demonstrate genuine investment in workers' growth, employees feel valued and reciprocate with loyalty.

Moreover, such initiatives strengthen corporate branding and competitive positioning. Employees actively promote these benefits through professional networks and social media, boosting the company's reputation as a talent-friendly workplace. Additionally, in today's ESG-conscious market, robust learning programs meet social responsibility metrics that appeal to investors and clients alike.

### Social life

##### stay in one city?
I firmly advocate for frequent relocation across cities, aligning with Claire’s perspective that novel environments combat mental stagnation. Neuroscientific studies confirm that adapting to unfamiliar settings stimulates neuroplasticity, enhancing cognitive flexibility and resilience—traits indispensable in today’s dynamic world. While the logistical hassles of moving exist, the long-term psychological dividends, such as heightened problem-solving skills, justify the effort.

Despite Andrew’s claim that long-term residence may foster close ties in a single community, mobile living can actually deepen social capital. By navigating diverse communities, individuals master intercultural communication—a skill paramount in globalized professions. Besides, unlike localized networks that often consist of homogenous contacts, mobile individuals tend to build diverse networks across industries and regions. My cousin, for instance, secured three job offers after relocating twice, attributing her success to an expanded network and nuanced understanding of regional professional norms.

### Virtual tools

##### Can on-site travel be replaced?
While the pandemic accelerated virtual tourism, offline travel has rebounded strongly post-lockdown because it offers irreplaceable benefits. As B correctly observes, virtual tours merely simulate environments superficially. The West Lake's charm, for instance, lies not just in visual reproduction, but in feeling its mild breezes and tasting local delicacies - sensations impossible to replicate digitally.

As technology evolves, creating truly realistic digital experiences may be possible through prohibitively expensive sensor networks, yet still missing the essence of travel: emotional connection. Unlike virtual tours that rely on static databases and fail to capture spontaneous human interactions, physical travel allows visitors to engage with locals - whether attraction staff or roadside vendors - experiencing authentic, evolving culture firsthand. Therefore, virtual tours cannot provide in-depth culture immersion, contrary to A's belief.

##### Should people treat AI with genuine respect?
While advanced AI like chatbots can generate human-like responses, I believe people shouldn't pay it genuine respect.

First, AI is merely a tool without life or entity, so paying it respect only harms productivity. Instead of processing with emotion, it dismantles people's input mechanically, so courtesy to it is extra information to handle, slowing down its response.

Secondly, treating AI with human-like regard poses psychological risks. These systems possess neither self-awareness nor accountability, making them incapable of reciprocating emotional investment. Tragically, there have already been cases where vulnerable individuals, such as a depressed person seeking solace in a chatbot, spiraled into despair when the AI’s memory reset erased their prior interactions. Therefore, instead of treating AI with respect, the energy should be invested in nurturing real human connections.

#### Personal trivia

##### plan ahead for day off?
The increasingly hectic schedules of modern life leave little time and energy for people to plan ahead, especially for 'less relevant' activities like taking some time off, just as Paul feels. However, I prefer to arrange my holidays so as to maximize their value.

First, this approach enables me to truly relax with an enhanced sense of control. Envision a weekend getaway to Beijing: if I have prepared meticulously, not only booking my flights, hotels, and restaurants, but also mapping out a sightseeing itinerary, I am more likely to enjoy a smooth holiday with less and a better mood. By contrast, without the planning, I may get frustrated by missing out on attractions I have yearned to visit.

Besides, looking ahead can help me achieve my goals, since I can easily slack off in extended holidays, squandering days aimlessly browsing social media or watching TV dramas, only to realize at the end of the day that I've accomplish nothing. As opposed to that, by setting daily tasks, such as dedicating an hour each morning painting or learning to cook a dish, I can gradually attain my goals, thus feeling content and proud of my achievements.

#### Spending a lot of time watching sports or following favorite team. negetive or positive effect for the person?

Excessive sports fandom can detrimentally affect both personal growth and mental health through two primary mechanisms. First, the inordinate time devoted to tracking games and teams displaces more productive activities. The hours spent watching matches or analyzing statistics could otherwise be invested in skill development or nurturing relationships, whose absence often leads to stunted personal progress and diminished self-esteem.

Second, disproportionate emotional attachment to athletic outcomes disrupts psychological equilibrium. The well-documented phenomenon of fan violence - from football hooliganism to post-game riots - demonstrates how sports allegiance can mutate into unhealthy identity fusion. When individuals experience visceral euphoria after victories or profound despair following defeats, they exhibit the hallmark symptoms of emotional dysregulation. What begins as leisure morphs into an unhealthy psychological crutch that compromises balanced living.

### School 
##### Should higher education be free?
While Claire argues that making higher education tuition-free can ease the financial strain on students from low-income families, disadvantaged students already gain access to college through existing scholarships and grant programs. In fact, the policy will prove counterproductive.

To begin with, eliminating tuition risks undermines students’ academic drive. When individuals invest financially in their education, they are more inclined to treat it seriously, striving to justify the cost. By contrast, when education is freely available and ubiquitous, its perceived value may diminish, leading to reduced effort and worse outcomes.

Secondly, the education quality can be enhanced with the tuition collected. Prestigious institutions, for example, can leverage this income to enhance faculty resources and upgrade facilities such as laboratories and libraries, thereby improving student outcomes. Besides, Without tuition income, universities would become overly dependent on state funding, which may erode their academic independence integrity in the long run.


##### Should teachers' salaries be comparable to those in high-earning professions?

Graduates’ declining interest in the teaching profession demands higher salaries, and I firmly believe that teachers deserve compensation comparable to doctors or lawyers, reflecting their indispensable role in society. As Claire notes, teachers endure demanding schedules that extend far beyond classroom instruction. In addition to lecturing, they must grade assignments, diagnose students’ learning difficulties, offer personalized support, and even make long journeys for home visits. Yet this immense workload is rarely matched by appropriate compensation, which discourages commitment.

Furthermore, competitive pay is essential for attracting and retaining talent. The top concern for graduates today is financial security. If salaries were higher, individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds who are genuinely passionate about education could pursue teaching without compromising their standard of living.

Ultimately, high salaries are not merely a form of income—they represent societal recognition of teachers’ critical contribution to future generations.

#### Will younger children or older teenagers benefit from group discussions more?

While I share Andrew's view that older high school students gain more from group learning, I disagree with his competitive premise. Teens excel not through competition but through developed collaboration skills. Younger children (5-11) lack understanding of discussion norms - they frequently interrupt or dominate conversations rather than listening attentively and using logical persuasion. This often leads to chaotic or unproductive exchanges. Older students, with greater social maturity, avoid these pitfalls.

Moreover, group discussions derive value from synthesizing diverse viewpoints, a process only meaningful for complex issues older students encounter. For instance, when debating unemployment benefit increases, students naturally divide: some emphasize enhanced social stability while others warn about reduced job-seeking motivation. Through such exchanges, they begin to appreciate real-world complexity and develop the cognitive agility needed for nuanced reasoning.

#### College-degree programs or short certifications?
The rise of "slash careers" reflects postmodern preferences for flexibility, yet traditional college degrees remain superior in fostering long-term success. While Kelly rightly highlights how short certifications cater to shifting interests, they lack the commitment mechanisms inherent in degree programs. What seems a blessing may turn into a curse, as students wander across unrelated courses and lose sight of their goals.

Unlike short-term certifications that often lack continuity and cumulative depth, college degrees offer a coherent framework that sustains students’ long-term engagement. Degree programs impose structured milestones—such as prerequisite hierarchies, thesis deadlines, and progressive coursework—that make it difficult to drift aimlessly across fields. This structure channels student effort toward mastery.

Moreover, traditional campus environments reinforce this focus. Social exposure to equally committed peers, even through casual interactions, strengthens motivation and normalizes persistence. Together, these mechanisms increase the number of hours students invest in a chosen discipline—widely regarded as the strongest predictor of long-term achievement.


#### Is lecturing effective teaching?
I believe lecturing remains irreplaceable. While Paul rightly notes that passive listening risks disengagement, his alternative—active learning—fails to address the core issue: unmotivated students will resist any method. Claire’s point now comes into play: brilliant lecturers transform impenetrable content into accessible and intriguing forms through their wit and passion for the subject, thus arousing students' study interest.

Moreover, lecturing’s superiority lies in its structured knowledge delivery, which scaffolds independent study. For instance, peer discussions often stray beyond students’ current grasp—such as debating quantum physics in an introductory course—whereas lectures provide expert-curated content with calibrated complexity. Lectures efficiently compress decades of expertise into digestible frameworks and present material in a logical sequence—not so challenging as to discourage learning, nor so simple as to give students a false sense of mastery. As a result, students are moderately challenged and improve both their understanding and competence more effectively.

#### prioritize academic facilities or invest as much money in sports

The modern epidemic of sedentary lifestyles has led to frequent ailments and skeletal disorders, even among university students. This trend, largely driven by excessive academic pressure, invalidates Rachel’s premise that sports programs are unnecessary. Instead, universities should increase investment in athletics to promote student well-being.

Enhanced funding provides students with access to state-of-the-art facilities and diverse sports programs, including tennis, bodybuilding, and shooting. When workouts align with individual fitness goals and interests, students are more likely to engage consistently and enthusiastically. 

Beyond physical health, sports cultivate essential soft skills such as teamwork, discipline, and leadership, all of which contribute to career success. For instance, volleyball, which demands strategic coordination, enhances systematic and long-term thinking—an invaluable skill in both professional and personal life. By integrating well-funded sports initiatives into university life, institutions can foster a healthier, more capable generation, ensuring that academic excellence does not come at the cost of well-being.

#### add student efforts to assessment crtiteria?

With modern education's emphasis on holistic development, schools are considering adding students' effort to assessment criteria. This approach is well-justified. As Paul rightly observes, it encourages students' consistent engagement. When evaluations rely solely on exam performance, students often resort to cramming or cheating, undermining Kelly's fairness principle. By contrast process-oriented assessment promotes daily participation, assignment completion, and regular review, leading to deeper subject mastery.

Moreover, effort-integrated evaluation provides a more accurate performance measure. Studies show test scores fluctuate significantly, making multi-criteria assessment essential for reliable academic records. This is particularly crucial for graduate schools and employers, who depend on transcripts to evaluate candidates. Specifically, the current exam-dominated system fails to reflect learning persistence, classroom contribution, and intellectual growth. Therefore, by valuing effort, schools create motivating assessments while maintaining academic rigor.
