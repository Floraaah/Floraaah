### Academic Discussion
##### Scientific Finding Disclosure
> Should scientific discoveries be shared freely among scientists throughout the world and that governments and companies should not keep any discoveries secret?
+ *So many restrictions, and 10 minutes' time for writing? I believe nearly no one will be willing to spend time contemplating the problem and will go stray more or less...I simply didn't bother.*
I believe the right to decide publish one's scientific discovery or not should be reserved to the discoverer. While as Paul argues, the discoverer deserve public recognition—typically only possible with public dissemination—many scientists prioritize contribution to the human welfare over fame. For instance, researchers publishing breakthroughs in renewable energy enable sequential innovation and broader application, boosting global solution to climate changes. Therefore, voluntary disclosure aligns with personal pursuit and societal development.
However, mandated disclosure can deter innovation by reducing incentives for private investors. Before patent systems, innovators risk losing profits to competitors through commercial espionage or reverse engineering, leading to positive externality problems. If discoveries were forcibly published today, the private sector would cut R&D funding, fearing inadequate returns. This would hinder technological progress, especially in fields like pharmaceuticals where breakthroughs rely on costly, years-long research.

#### Workplace

##### Four-day workweek
While Claire points out the frictions of switching from a five-day workweek to a four-day one, the difficulty is temporal rather than fundamental—the six-week schedule was not abolished until decades ago, yet nobody today questions the five-day one. Generally, I believe the benefits of a shortened weekday outweigh troubles it may bring.
First, productivity improves. Five consecutive workdays often lead to Friday fatigue, diminishing employees' focus. By contrast, a condensed workweek encourages efficiency, as employees stay fresher and more engaged. For instance, a Microsoft Japan trial saw a 40% productivity boost after adopting the new schedule, proving shorter workweek yields better output.
Second, individual wellbeing and economy activity rise. A three-day weekend enables more leisure travel or personal development, increasing consumer spending, especially in hospitality and retail sectors. For example, workers can take weekend trips to nearby cities, boosting local tourism.

##### Communication methods
